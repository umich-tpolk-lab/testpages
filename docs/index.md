Description of task: 

This is a 6 minute long task of 24 blocks. Twelve of these are 20-second stimulus blocks consisting of images of faces and houses (six face blocks, six house blocks). The remaining 12 are 10-second blocks of a fixation cross that alternate with the stimulus blocks. Stimuli are pseudorandomized and are presented for 500ms with a 500ms interstimulus interval. 

This task includes six catch trials, three in face blocks and three in house blocks, to ensure the participant is awake. Female faces and apartment buildings indicate catch trials, and the participant is instructed to use their right index finger to press a button upon seeing these trial images. There is approximately one catch trial per minute, and only one catch trial in any one block.
